#Health Care and Well-Being Systems
This website is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for users to keep track of their health records (PHRs). It is designed to be easy to use for both patients and caregivers, even if they are not professionally trained.

#Frontend Development

I have developed a frontend part. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS. The frontend is also responsive, meaning that it will look good on all devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

#Features

The frontend of this website includes the following features:

A user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to add, edit, and view their PHRs
The ability to share PHRs with other users
The ability to download PHRs in a variety of formats
The ability to set reminders for appointments or medications
